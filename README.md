## 1. How to run current dev version
1. Start by going into the *keycloak-17.0.1* folder inside of this folder.
2. CD into the bin folder where you will start a CMD window from.
3. When in your CMD window type: *kc.bat start-dev* and keycloak should be running if you have your JAVA_HOME set.
4. If you do not have your JAVA_HOME set follow this link to configure it before doing so make sure you configure jdk-18: [link](https://www.baeldung.com/java-home-on-windows-7-8-10-mac-os-x-linux)
5. After configuring this go back to step 2. *IMPORTANT TO START A NEW CMD INSTANCE OTHERWISE CONFIGURATION DOESN'T UPDATE*
